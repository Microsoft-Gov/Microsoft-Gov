## Welcome to Microsoft's site for the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) response
We are getting many requests for help to get accurate information out by all means. One of the quickest and most effective ways to disseminate information and take pressure off call queues is to implement a chatbot on your website. Visitors can interact with the bot without having to comb through FAQs, and hopefully find the information they need without resorting to calling your call center. Many orgs see 10-30% reductions in call volumes by implementing conversational chatbots on their website.

### Covid-19 Chatbot Description
Microsoft has assembled a package of assets customers can use to develop and deploy Covid-19 informational chatbots in a single day.  Chatbots are useful for providing answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) and offer another communication channel in addition to your website or customer service organization. We expect organization to receive an extremely high volume of inquiries during the Covid-19 crisis. It is important that health, work, and safety related information be readily accessible. Powered by Azure, the Covid-19 Chatbot will effortlessly scale to meet demand. The Covid-19 Chatbot can be used for both internal communication with your employees or external communication with your customers. It will reduce the amount of time IT, human resources, and customer service staff spend answering questions, thereby enabling them to focus on higher value activities.
